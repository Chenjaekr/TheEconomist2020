###### Price and prejudice
# Analysts’ stock recommendations are coloured by their cultural biases

THE “SELL-SIDE” equity analysts who work for investment banks are often accused of being less than completely objective. Because they need to maintain close ties with the companies they cover, they may be too eager to accept managers’ rosy earnings projections. They might also feel pressure to talk up a firm’s prospects because their banks stand to profit from underwriting fees. But professional and economic incentives are not the only possible sources of bias. A new working paper by Vesa Pursiainen of the University of Hong Kong argues that sell-side analysts are also swayed by national prejudices.
The study makes use of a survey conducted by Eurobarometer, which asked residents of 15 European countries how much they thought people of particular nationalities could be trusted. Unsurprisingly, people said they had the most faith in their compatriots. The data also reveal that bilateral trust varies greatly by region. Whereas most Europeans polled tend to see those from the north of the continent as more trustworthy, southern Europeans stand out by considering their fellow Mediterraneans to be the most reliable.

By comparing these levels of bilateral trust across countries, Mr Pursiainen developed a measure of “trust bias”. Finns, for example, show a trust bias against Italians. They do not merely distrust Italians more than they distrust other nations (a view shared by many) but distrust them more than other Europeans do.
Mr Pursiainen then matched these numbers with a database of 1.3m sell-side recommendations issued between 1996 and 2018. He concludes that trust bias is a good predictor of how analysts rate particular stocks. Eurobarometer’s data show that Norwegians are disproportionately likely to trust people from Denmark and Britain. Accordingly, Mr Pursiainen finds that Norwegian analysts, as identified by their surnames, are 8.4 percentage points more likely to recommend Danish stocks than Austrian analysts are, and 6.7 percentage points more likely to recommend British firms than French analysts are. This effect seems to be especially strong in the cases of companies whose names contain the names of their home countries (such as Deutsche Bank).


In theory, such a pattern might arise because analysts tend to be better informed about firms based in nearby countries. Yet the study finds that even after accounting for distance, trust bias still seems to influence analysts’ opinions on shares.
The power of trust bias appears to be strongest in times of political or economic turmoil. During the euro zone’s sovereign-debt squeeze in 2011-13, analysts from northern Europe became far more bearish on southern European stocks than their Mediterranean peers were. Ever since their country voted to leave the EU, British analysts have become much more optimistic about domestic firms’ prospects, relative to analysts from the continent.
It is unclear whether analysts are aware of the bias in their recommendations. They may think that a firm’s nationality does not affect their judgment, or that they are correctly accounting for the context in which a company operates. Alternatively, they might be pandering to their audience. As Greece defaulted on bonds held in spades by German entities, it would have taken a brave German analyst to endorse Greek shares. In any case, it is another reason to be cautious about sell-side analysis. ■
