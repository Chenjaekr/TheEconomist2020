The Truants. By Kate Weinberg. G.P. Putnam’s Sons; 320 pages; $26. Bloomsbury Publishing; £14.99.
MENTION AGATHA CHRISTIE, and what springs to mind is the use of poison to bump off her victims, starting with the strychnine in “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” (1920). She is less associated with campus mysteries, even though “Cat Among the Pigeons” (1959) takes place at a girls’ school. For that sub-genre, crime aficionados are more likely to think of Dorothy L. Sayers or P.D. James.

Both elements meet in “The Truants”, Kate Weinberg’s deliciously creepy addition to the campus-mystery catalogue. Farm girl Jess Walker goes to university in Norfolk—where Ms Weinberg earned a creative-writing degree from the University of East Anglia—for just one reason: she wants to take classes with Lorna Clay, known for a book called “The Truants” and for “‘rescuing’ female authors who had been lost or dismissed from the canon as irrelevant”. Authors such as Christie.
Jess signs up for Lorna’s seminar and befriends three other students. Georgie has wrist wounds—“like spatters of very pale paint, almost silvery from age”—which are only one sign of her problems. Nick is a “rock geek” who studies geology and falls for Jess. She prefers Alec, a white South African journalist on leave to write a book.
Naturally, these relationships are not always what they seem. Students speculate about the reasons why Lorna left Cambridge for Norfolk. She fuels the rumours by writing on the board, “People disappear when they most want to be seen”, and by reminding her class that Christie’s greatest mystery occurred in her own life: her 11-day disappearance in 1926 after she learned that her husband was having an affair. A death and the possibility of poisoning also feature in Ms Weinberg’s plot.
Like Christie’s, her characters sometimes give over-long explanatory speeches. But she exhibits some of the queen of crime’s best traits, too. Part of Christie’s appeal, Ms Weinberg knows, is her recognition that for many, innocents as well as scoundrels, outward behaviour is a series of veils that shroud their true identities. In “The Truants”, readers never quite grasp the characters’ motives until the end. Skilfully, the novel shows that some university experiences do resemble a country manor with strychnine on the premises. All that refinement may be only an illusion. ■
