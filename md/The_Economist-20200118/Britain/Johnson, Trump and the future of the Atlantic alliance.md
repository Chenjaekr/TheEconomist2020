BRITAIN HAS often been ridiculed as America’s poodle. This week Boris Johnson appeared to stay in character. On January 14th Britain, with France and Germany, invoked a dispute-resolution mechanism in response to Iranian steps away from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the multinational nuclear deal signed in 2015 and abandoned by America in 2018. “Let’s work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead,” said Mr Johnson.
The prime minister is not the first leader to propose rebranding as a salve to the presidential ego. But his sycophancy was sweetener to a snub: Britain is spurning President Donald Trump’s increasingly strident demands to reimpose sanctions on Iran, siding with European allies over America. And that is not the only place where Anglo-American trust is fraying.

On January 12th Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, questioned America’s reliability as a partner: “I worry if the United States withdraws from its leadership around the world…the assumptions of 2010 that we were always going to be part of a US coalition is really just not where we are going to be.” That would expose gaping holes in Britain’s forces, warned Mr Wallace. “We are very dependent on American air cover and American intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. We need to diversify our assets.”
The minister’s “remarkable candour” is a “big moment”, says Michael Clarke, a former director of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank. “You won’t find that thought in any government defence or foreign-policy document of the last 70 years.” Mr Wallace’s intervention comes as the Ministry of Defence is preparing the most significant strategic defence and security review (SDSR) for a generation. The last three reviews—in 1998, 2010 and 2015—acknowledged that Britain would be unlikely to fight on its own; they assumed that America was the probable partner.
Why is Britain going wobbly now? One former defence official suggests that Mr Wallace is launching a pre-emptive attack on those in the Conservative Party and the Treasury who would like the country to buy its arms off-the-shelf from America, rather than making them at home. Britain’s current (and risky) plan is to develop its own next-generation warplane, Tempest, rather than accept a junior position in an American project. Mr Trump’s disdain for allies is another factor, and there is a strategic difference, too. “We fear Russia most, while the US most fears China,” says a British diplomat. Referring to wars in which America and Britain fought without the other, he suggests that “the prospect for another Vietnam/Grenada or Falklands/Sierra Leone may be increasing.”
The divergence over China burst into public view this week when Mr Johnson indicated that he would break with America on the question of whether to allow kit made by Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, to be used in fifth-generation (5G) mobile-phone networks. Huawei’s products are both cheaper and more advanced than those from its chief competitors—Nokia, a Finnish firm, and Ericsson, a Swedish one—but America worries that they could be used by Chinese spies to snoop on electronic communications or even sabotage networks remotely.
Breaking up would be expensive to do
A decision is due by the end of the month, but it seems likely that Britain will rebuff American entreaties. British spooks are convinced that the danger posed by Chinese kit can be managed by confining Huawei to less-sensitive parts of the network, and by tearing down and inspecting its gear before approving it. Threats to cut off intelligence are seen as a bluff. Britain is, behind America, the second-most-capable member of the Five Eyes, an electronic-spying pact with roots in the second world war and which includes Canada, Australia and New Zealand. But that pact also indicates just how hard it would be for Britain to loosen its transatlantic bonds.
Ever since the second world war, Britain’s military forces, nuclear capabilities and intelligence agencies have been deeply entwined with those of America. The Royal Navy’s new aircraft-carrier (pictured on the previous page visiting New York) will embark on its first mission next year with American jets on board. Britain’s nuclear-tipped Trident missiles are drawn from a common pool in the state of Georgia. And even beyond the Five Eyes, British and American spies are joined at the hip; in 2015 the Pentagon’s intelligence agency appointed a Royal Air Force officer as its deputy director. How such intimacy would play out in a crisis is unclear: warplanes aboard an aircraft-carrier cannot easily recuse themselves from action.
The SDSR will also have to confront the forbidding financial implications of acting without America, not least in the two areas where Mr Wallace pointed to the greatest dependence: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR, in the jargon, meaning spying on things, mostly from planes and satellites) and air cover. Advanced spy satellites cost billions and the space budget is stretched: Britain plans to splash out up to £5bn to reduce its dependence on American GPS satellites, having been kicked out of Europe’s Galileo programme. “Britain can only afford very specific and niche capabilities,” says Bleddyn Bowen of the University of Leicester. Mr Bowen says that Britain’s lone spy satellite, Carbonite-2, is “very experimental”. A planned constellation of small radar satellites—Project Oberon—would have to be procured in large numbers to provide meaningful coverage.
Home-grown air cover would also come with a hefty bill. The British Army, halved in size since the Falklands war of 1982, seeks to be able to deploy the whole of a combat division (40,000 or so troops). But a lack of air-defences means that fielding anything above a brigade (5,000 troops) without American support would leave troops dangerously exposed to enemy warplanes and missiles.
If Britain is to pull away from America, the obvious place to turn to is Europe. Brexit will shut Britain out of EU defence schemes, but it may still have a role. The idea of “strategic autonomy”, a more independent European foreign and security policy, has become a rallying cry on the continent and several countries are keen to keep Britain involved. “The British must be a partner on European defence,” insisted Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, in an interview with The Economist in November. Yet the closer Britain clings to Europe, the less likely it is to get a generous trade deal from America. That, as Mr Johnson is finding, is the problem faced by a small power stuck between two great powers.■
