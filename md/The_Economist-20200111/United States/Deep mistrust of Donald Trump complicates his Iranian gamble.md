IN HIS THREE years in the White House, President Donald Trump has relished taking risks in foreign policy. He ramped up the rhetoric on North Korea (boasting about the size of his nuclear button and mocking “Little Rocket Man”), launched multiple trade wars and threatened to walk out of NATO. Yet he has, in the end, often opted for relative safety. He preferred jaw-jaw to war-war with North Korea, agreed to a new NAFTA and now says that he wants NATO “to become much more involved” in the Middle East.
That makes his decision to kill Qassem Suleimani, Iran’s most powerful military leader, all the more striking. It was, by all accounts, the riskiest of the options presented to the president as tensions with Iran mounted—an action guaranteed to provoke revenge (which duly started with missile attacks on American airbases in Iraq on January 8th) and which could lead to war. It looks like the biggest roll of the dice of Mr Trump’s presidency. Circumstances both abroad and at home only amplify the gamble.

Abroad, confidence in Mr Trump is in the dumps. Each spring pollsters at Pew Research Centre track global opinion of America and its president. The results of the survey for 2019, released on January 8th, are grim. Across 32 countries, a median of just 29% trust Mr Trump to do the right thing in world affairs, compared with 64% who do not. He is trusted marginally more than Xi Jinping and less than Vladimir Putin. True, Mr Trump’s numbers have improved a bit since 2018. He gets positive reviews in a few places, including Israel, India and Poland, and sentiment towards the United States is more favourable than towards its president. But his ratings remain far below Barack Obama’s, and deep in negative territory among European allies such as Britain, France and Germany, where a mere 13% have faith in his foreign policy.
Such attitudes make these countries warier than they might otherwise be of rallying behind Mr Trump. In the aftermath of the strike, Mike Pompeo, America’s secretary of state, expressed frustration that European allies had not been as helpful as he would have liked. In a deepening Gulf crisis, Mr Trump will need friends.
He will also need support at home. But there, too, the president has a serious problem of trust, at least beyond his devoted Republican base. The showdown with Iran comes at a time when America is split down the middle over Mr Trump’s impeachment. At the heart of the case for removing him from office is an accusation that he abused his position by pursuing partisan political ends at the expense of national security in dealings with Ukraine.
Inevitably, Democrats are now also questioning the motives and thinking behind the Suleimani killing. Was it legal? (Maybe, by American standards.) How “imminent” was the threat to American lives? (Perhaps not very.) Was Mr Trump seeking to divert attention from impeachment? (This slur was also levelled against Bill Clinton after he ordered cruise-missile strikes at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.) Did the Trump administration have a thought-through strategy? (The haphazard handling of the aftermath of the strike does not inspire confidence.)
In Congress, Democrats prepared to respond to what Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, called the administration’s “provocative and disproportionate” drone strike by voting on a war-powers resolution seeking to limit hostilities against Iran without congressional approval. Democratic presidential hopefuls have vied with one another to condemn Mr Trump. Elizabeth Warren accused him of “threatening to commit war crimes”. Joe Biden denounced “a crisis totally of Donald Trump’s making”. Claiming a “right to assassinate”, warned Bernie Sanders, risked “unleashing international anarchy”. One lesson from the Middle East over the past 20 years, said Pete Buttigieg, is that “taking out a bad guy is not necessarily a good idea”.
More ominously for Mr Trump, some of his biggest supporters have also expressed scepticism. Tucker Carlson, a Fox News pundit from the isolationist wing of the Republican Party, has distanced himself from his channel’s cheerleading for the president. Conventional wisdom within the foreign-policy establishment has long held that it is foolish to imagine America can leave the Middle East to everyone else. Anti-establishment types who approved of Mr Trump’s determination to stop its “endless wars” wonder why he is instead digging in.
Muddy waters
Part of the answer is surely a desire not to appear weak. Last year Mr Trump let several apparent Iranian provocations go unanswered. He called off a missile strike planned in response to the downing of an American drone, and failed to hit back after attacks on Saudi oil refineries. The last straw seems to have been the siege of the American embassy in Baghdad by pro-Iranian protesters, amid echoes of Benghazi in 2012 or Tehran in 1979. Killing General Suleimani offered a dramatic way to restore a sense of American deterrence, in Iran and far beyond—with the added attraction, for Mr Trump, of picking an option Mr Obama had rejected.
Then there is the official explanation: that the Iranian general was planning to kill more Americans. Mr Trump has long surrounded himself with Iran hawks. One, Mr Pompeo, insisted this week that America had a clear strategy of confronting and containing Iran, and that killing General Suleimani was the right decision. Failing to do so, claimed the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, would have been “culpably negligent”.
Will Mr Trump’s gamble work? His past pattern suggests he is betting he can soon settle for safety, after only minimal reprisals. He has told Iranians he is “ready to embrace peace”. But if he is sucked into tit-for-tat escalation, he will not only further outrage Democrats but risk losing part of his own base, at a time when he can ill afford it. Strangely but perhaps not surprisingly, for someone so keen to disengage from the region, his presidency could now depend on what happens in the Middle East. ■
