Treating menopause
We read with consternation your recommendation of hormone therapy (HT) for menopausal women (“The time of her life”, ). The media swing from admonishing women that hormone therapy will hasten their death to advising them that it will save their lives. Although HT has very real benefits for alleviating menopausal symptoms, no consistent evidence shows that it prevents cardiovascular disease. Some studies suggest a benefit, others find no benefit or even harm. The problem arises when the findings of one study are disregarded while the findings of another (potentially even more flawed) study are taken as fact.

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews consolidate evidence across multiple randomised clinical trials. Overall, randomised controlled trials have shown that HT has no net effect on risk of death and no reduction in coronary heart disease regardless of whether it was initiated at a younger or older age. Finally, a recent Cochrane Review specifically states that HT should not be used to prevent cardiovascular disease on the basis of the current evidence. The claim that hormone therapy saves lives is rooted in sensationalism, not science.

As a life scientist, I have long been dismayed by the quality of the research conducted by the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). As a woman, I have been stunned by the willingness of most members of the medical community to accept the WHI report and its recommendations without question, continually recommending that women avoid or discontinue hormone therapy.
I once asked my doctor whether he had seen any positive effects in patients who take the treatment. “Yes,” he said, “they don’t grow old as fast.” So, I am delighted that The Economist has had the courage to do what too few others have done: debunk the WHI study and recommend the health advantages of HT.

You say that despite a public scare based on the flawed WHI study, hormone therapy has the potential to safely improve women’s lives. Yet in “Naked Statistics”, written by Charles Wheelan in 2013, the WHI study is presented as a rigorous controlled experiment. He quotes a statement that the death toll from unnecessarily prescribed HT is in the “tens of thousands”. It would appear that the evidence is on The Economist’s side. Yet what is a non-specialist to do? Despite reaching opposite conclusions, both The Economist and Mr Wheelan write clearly and with the confidence of experts. Unfortunately, that leaves the rest of us ever warier.

The patents process is fair
Rolling back the advances that have been made in America’s patent system (“The trouble with patent-troll hunting”, ) would only reduce fairness and vastly increase the cost of patent disputes. You pointed to the example of a small firm with “no in-house lawyers” that has run up expensive bills defending the validity of its asserted patents before the US Patent and Trademark Office. Yet these inter partes reviews are fair, highly successful administrative proceedings created by Congress in 2011.
In fact, the USPTO process costs less than litigating the issues in federal court. Small businesses, often manufacturers, rely on these more cost-effective administrative proceedings to avoid the crushing costs of litigation when patents of dubious validity are brought against them. Reducing the cost of a meritorious patent challenge, and clarifying the standards of patentability, improve the patent system by making it more efficient, thereby reducing the opportunity for rent-seeking behaviour. It has been estimated that reviews before the USPTO have reduced the cumulative cost of patent litigation by billions of dollars.

Unintended consequences
You commended the decision by Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, to don a headscarf when she comforted relatives of the victims of an attack on mosques (“The improvement prize”, ). Ms Ardern even inspired a group of women to start the Headscarf for Harmony initiative, a hit on social media. Yet many Muslim women who are campaigning not to have to cover their head disagree with these symbolic acts.
Ms Ardern and others might have meant well. But female Muslims who have had to endure punishments and harassment to stand by their freedom of appearance now face renewed rebuke from their families, who watched non-Muslims honour the hijab.

From hero to zero
There is an interesting historical nugget to Andrew Johnson’s acquittal by the Senate following his impeachment by the House in 1868 (“The die is cast”, ). The president was cleared by the Senate after it fell just one vote short to remove him from office. The man who cast the decisive vote to acquit, Edmund Ross of Kansas, became the subject of a chapter in John F. Kennedy’s “Profiles in Courage” for resisting party pressure to dump Johnson and install a fellow Republican in the Oval Office. The book won a Pulitzer prize, but this account of Ross acting as a bulwark against despotism has been called into question, as many contemporary scholars believe he was merely bribed by Johnson’s cronies.

Hot off the press!
Your Christmas special on hot-metal type printing brought tears to my eyes (“The age of mechanical reproduction as a work of art”, ). I remember visiting my father at the New York Post in its old headquarters on South Street. My favourite place was the press room where they made hot type. While reading the article, I saw Lenny, the senior Linotype operator, in his white apron hunched over the keyboard, typing with two fingers, cigarette in his mouth, ashes all over the keyboard. The smell of molten metal and printer’s ink. I stood transfixed and watched the magic of this huge machine producing metal letters.
Lenny would hold them in his blistered and calloused hands, turning them over and peering intently at each letter. Every so often he would take one and shove it at me. “Take this, kid,” he would say. I didn’t realise at the time that they were the rejects, but I clutched them as if they were rare gems dug out of a deep mine. I took them home and saved every one. Decades and many apartments and homes later, I still have the precious relics in the top drawer of my desk.
