ON JANUARY 28TH Airbus agreed to pay Britain’s Serious Fraud Office and its French and American counterparts €3.6bn ($4bn) to settle a bribery case, pending court approval. The penalty relates to alleged payments to third-party consultants in several markets. Under a deferred prosecution agreement the planemaker will face no formal charges. Though prosecutors may pursue individuals, no British dpa has so far led to a conviction.
