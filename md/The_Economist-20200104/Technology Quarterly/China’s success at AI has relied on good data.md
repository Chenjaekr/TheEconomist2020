CHINA IS THE land of face recognition. Cameras able to extract face prints from passers-by are common in the streets of large cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Boxy vending machines at airports offer to let you pay for a cup of orange juice, robot-squeezed for perfect freshness, by scanning your face. From December 1st all people applying for an account with one of China’s telecoms companies such as China Mobile must have their face scanned. Previous regulations required proof of identity, but the possession of users’ face prints will let firms verify identities in real-time via smartphone cameras. 
Considering the oppressive purposes to which this technology is being put—most notably in the Muslim-majority areas of north-west China—it would not be appropriate to call China’s rapid adoption of it anything more than a technical success. The underappreciated fact that companies leaping ahead in the field are more reliant on cleverly deployed cheap labour for their progress than on any technological edge, suggests another reason for caution before declaring a Chinese victory in the tech wars. But understanding how China has got face recognition to flourish is nonetheless instructive. Two of the world’s most valuable startups, Megvii and SenseTime, worth $4bn and $7.5bn respectively, are Chinese AI companies specialising in the field. Their application of it alone would make it one of the most widely deployed forms of artificial intelligence in the world. 
Like most companies deploying intelligent software, Megvii and SenseTime rely on a technique called machine learning. They do not ask their human coders to program computers with rules that distinguish between one face and another. Instead the coders provide the computer with masses of data about faces, usually photographs, and write software which trawls through those photos looking for patterns which can be used reliably to tell one unique face from another. The patterns picked up by that learning software make better rules for recognising faces than anything a human coder could describe explicitly. Humans are good at recognising faces but, with the right software, computers can learn to be much better. Face-recognition software is much easier and cheaper to deploy than human recognisers. It just needs software, powerful computers and data—the new trinity of AI. 
It is in the third of those categories, people will warn you, that China’s great advantage lies. It has loads of data. But its advantage is subtler than that. Data alone are not much use for building AI software. They must first be labelled. This means that the data set must be endowed with the contextual information that computers need in order to learn statistical associations between components of that data set and their meaning to human beings. 
To learn to differentiate between cats and dogs, a computer is first shown pictures in which each animal is correctly labelled. To learn to distinguish between one person’s face and another, a computer must first be shown what a face is, using labelled data, and then how to tell the difference between cheekbones and brows, again via human labelling. Only with enough labelled instructions will it be able to start recognising faces without human help. 
Underpinning companies like Megvii and SenseTime is a sprawling digital infrastructure through which data are collected, cleaned and labelled before being processed into the machine-learning software that makes face recognition tick. Just as Apple adds its brand to phones mostly assembled by cheap Chinese labour, so too the Chinese AI companies design and brand AI software and services which sit atop a data supply chain using cheap labour at Chinese data factories no one has ever heard of. Megvii has spent 218m yuan ($31m) on labelled data in the past three and a half years, according to its IPO prospectus. Many of the algorithms used contain little that is not available to any computer-science graduate student on Earth. Without China’s data-labelling infrastructure, which is without peer, they would be nowhere. 
Charles Liu is the founder of one of China’s largest data factories, known in English by the initials MBH. He employs 300,000 data labellers across China’s poorest provinces. Each labeller works a six-hour shift each day, tagging a stream of faces, medical imagery and cityscapes. MBH pushes a stream of data to them as if on a digital conveyor belt, and they churn through it, creating the syllabus from which machines learn. They can turn it off to take a bathroom break, but that is the extent of their control. They do not choose which data to label but have them chosen for them. 
Mr Liu claims that MBH’s trick is not just numbers, but the methods the firm uses to distribute labelling work efficiently to its workers. This is done using the same kind of machine-learning systems that Amazon, an American e-commerce giant, uses to recommend products to its customers. Instead of suggesting stuff to shoppers, MBH assigns labelling tasks to workers. First, it gathers data from its workers as they carry out labelling jobs. Mr Liu says the company records its workers’ gaze, mouse movements and keyboard strokes. It also takes note of what sort of data-labelling task the worker is performing, from medical-imagery labelling to text translation. By measuring performance according to the type of task, he says, he is able to find workers who are better at some tasks than others, and steer those tasks to those workers. 
All of this happens automatically as MBH’s customers feed tasks into the company. At its most finely tuned, Mr Liu says these systems let his army of workers classify data almost in real time. In work for TikTok, a popular short-form video app owned by ByteDance, a company based in Beijing, he says MBH’s data labellers handle imagery which TikTok’s automated system cannot be sure is not pornographic. MBH shows the putative porn to hundreds or thousands of human workers who, like Justice Potter Stewart, know it when they see it. The company then returns their aggregated answer to TikTok in less than a second. 
For their efforts, MBH’s workers are paid an average salary of 3,000 yuan ($425) per month, three times more than the average worker in China’s poorest regions. Mr Liu can deploy wage arbitrage between the richest and poorest places, using the internet. In many ways MBH’s business works like Uber, a ride-hailing firm, as a crowdsourcing platform connecting supply of labour with demand. But the minimum wage that Uber can reasonably expect its drivers to take home is constrained by geography, as its drivers must live within a few hours of their markets. This restricts them to urban areas with high living costs, putting a lower bound on even the stingiest wage. Mr Liu suffers no such constraints. Workers from areas in which 3,000 yuan per month is a fine wage can happily label data for AI companies in Shenzhen, where it is not. 
Many provincial governments are keen to get Mr Liu to open a data factory in their region and offer much-needed jobs. For every 5,000 workers MBH employs in a given month, local governments pay the firm 50,000 yuan. Across all 300,000 workers that adds up to 3m yuan ($425,000) in government money every month. 
Mr Liu says that his firm sees fewer and fewer face-recognition labelling tasks these days compared with the boom of 2017. Increasingly common now are labelling requests for medical imagery from which software can learn to diagnose disease. There are also endless streetscapes which, once labelled, can teach autonomous cars about the cities they must navigate. Those are more difficult labelling tasks. Whereas every human knows what a face looks like, not everyone understands what a tumour looks like in an X-ray. Labelling such conditions requires specialist knowledge, and means that MBH must pay its labellers more money. Still, those labelling requests are indicative of the kinds of AI service that may reach widespread adoption in China in a few years’ time. Mr Liu says he will expand his workforce by 50% next year. 
Without this data-labelling infrastructure, China’s AI services would not have taken off. Labelling services like MBH are what have allowed Alibaba to create a powerful machine-learning service like Taobao’s image-based product search. An Alibaba shopper can take a photo of an item in a shop window and immediately be steered to a page where they can purchase it. Alibaba processes a billion images like this a day. It also relies on labelled data for the machine-learning algorithms that are used in its retail stores, which operate under the brand Hema. Cameras installed throughout the glitzy new supermarkets track shoppers around the store and identify the products they take off the shelves. 
Masses of labelled data don’t just make for powerful machine-learning software. By studying the inner workings of the software, microprocessor architects can concoct powerful new chips designed specifically to run machine-learning tasks. China’s digital infrastructure has produced some of the world’s most powerful such systems. Now those systems are producing, in turn, AI chips that are competitive with the best Silicon Valley has to offer. ■
