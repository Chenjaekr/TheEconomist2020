IN MOST BIG economies the government’s budget plans seldom drive large movements in the stockmarket. Except in India. Bosses and investors parse the documents for clues about which industries or firms gained favour and which fell out of it. Markets react accordingly.

This year’s budget came on February 1st, a Saturday. Stockmarkets held a special weekend session. Bosses and investors were glued to TV screens as the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, recited the provisions—until, after a record two hours and 41 minutes, she was too exhausted to go on.
