Spain announced a complicated four-phase, eight-week return to a “new normality”, which will vary in speed between provinces. If all goes well, Spaniards will be able to return to beaches and bars by the end of June, and in some places before then. France also outlined its own “deconfinement” strategy. Most businesses will be allowed to reopen from May 11th, except for cafés, restaurants and large public spaces such as museums; public transport will largely resume too. The French prime minister said this was necessary to avoid economic collapse. France also suffered some alarming instances of rioting. See .
The chief executive of Heathrow called for the mandatory testing of passengers for covid-19 at airports in Britain,because travellers are currently allowed to enter the country “without visible measures in place”.

In El Salvador the president, Nayib Bukele, encouraged police to use “lethal force” against criminals following dozens of murders over a few days. The country’s homicide rate, one of the world’s highest, has fallen since Mr Bukele became president in June.

Brazil’s justice minister, Sérgio Moro, quit after the country’s populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, sacked the head of the federal police.

Dozens of people were killed when a fuel lorry rigged with explosives was detonated in the Syrian city of Afrin, which is controlled by Turkish forces and their local allies. Turkey’s defence minister blamed a Kurdish militia, the YPG, which was pushed out of the city two years ago.
Southern separatists in Yemen broke a peace deal with the internationally recognised government and claimed control of the port city of Aden. The separatists are backed by the United Arab Emirates; the government, by Saudi Arabia. All four are ostensibly on the same side in the war against the Houthi rebels, who control the north. See .

Saudi Arabia said it would no longer execute people who committed crimes when they were children. It also banned flogging as a punishment. But the beheadings continue: 184 people were put to death last year, a record for the kingdom. See .

The navy wants to give him his command back, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff is pushing for a full inquiry.
Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, warned that coronavirus “doesn’t take the weekends off” after two southern counties in the state re-opened beaches.
China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, said it would convene its annual session on May 22nd. The meeting, which normally lasts for about ten days, had been scheduled for early March but was delayed because of the pandemic. The event will involve thousands of people from around the country.
Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, remained invisible. He has not been seen in public since April 11th, prompting speculation that he is sick. America and South Korea said they saw no sign of anything unusual. Mr Kim is the third-generation hereditary ruler of a supposedly communist state. He has no publicly designated successor. See .
The government of India said it would allow migrant workers stranded far from their home villages to return to them if they wanted. Many of the workers had lost their jobs as a result of a national coronavirus lockdown, but the associated curbs on travel had left them with nowhere to go.
