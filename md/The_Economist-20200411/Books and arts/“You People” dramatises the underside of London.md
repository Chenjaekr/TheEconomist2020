You People. By Nikita Lalwani.Viking; 240 pages; £12.99.
SIVARAM SHAN is on a London bus when he is insulted by a mother with a sick child. Heading home after a long hospital wait, the woman has no doubt who is to blame for the health system’s burdens, slapping him with the lazy xenophobic slur that provides the title of Nikita Lalwani’s emotive third novel.

It opens in 2003 in a south-west London neighbourhood on the cusp of gentrification. There, alongside a Polish greasy spoon, an Australian pub and a Chinese grocery, sits the Pizzeria Vesuvio. Its Singaporean owner, Tuli, is a ponytailed live wire who sweeps in wearing a gangster’s floor-length leather coat and presents himself as the local benefactor, serving off-menu cigarettes and loans to waifs and strays.
Tuli’s devoted but hard-up employees include Nia, a 19-year-old Welsh-Indian waitress and Oxford drop-out, and Shan himself, a trainee geologist who has fled to Britain from the Sri Lankan civil war. Compelled to claim asylum after his father was murdered on the street by government forces, he is unable to trace the wife and young son he left behind.
This sinuous morality tale unfurls from the alternating perspectives of Nia and Shan. Slinking along like a thriller, it encompasses people-smuggling, the labyrinthine inhumanity of Britain’s immigration system, alcoholism and a class prejudice that cuts both ways. Kindness and its motives are a constant preoccupation. There are worlds within worlds in this metropolis, an incubator of crippling loneliness as well as of very real, if makeshift, communities. “This is London,” Shan reflects as he traverses a grim dual carriageway fringed with blossoming trees. “This contrary indication of motor-loud madness and real, actual breathing life.”
As Shan navigates the instability and sheer exhaustion of life as an illegal migrant, Tuli steps in to help find his missing family, opening a trapdoor into a shady underworld. Meanwhile, Nia (the least convincing of Ms Lalwani’s characters) reveals demons of her own.
Theirs is a dark story, but even at its bleakest, Ms Lalwani’s prose has a balletic lightness. She notes the way a would-be rapist is “sticky with the eyes”, or a drug-dealer’s “large white wedding cake of a trainer”, then pivots to calculate the toll exacted by the moral challenges that Shan and his counterparts face every day. Her blunt title ultimately comes to seem at once an accusation of her readers and an ethical imperative: to recognise the individuality of struggling people who can often seem invisible to the likes of the diners at the Vesuvio.
